# Material-UI Projects
## What is this?
This is a repository where I will store my experiments with the Material-UI components library.

## Why are you doing this?
As a developer with obsessive compulsive disorder who is often 'paralysed' by choice, I can spend excessive (unnecessary) time on the styling of an app.  I like the idea that I can create universally recognised/acceptable styles quickly for my apps.

## What projects do you intend to build?

- Todos *(a staple of any project series!)*
- Notes
- Pairs game
- Recipe book
- Markdown editor
